# Minimum Spanning Tree on a 2D Array

This project is dedicted to modifying a minimum spanning tree algorithm to distort an image or text based on a seed input.

The first step is storing information in a 2d array or image. By editing the least significant bit of a cell, we could visually hide a significant amount of information in a small image.

The next step was deciding which cells to store information in based on the path generated by a minimum spanning tree.

The weights from each cell to the next is determined by a seed either randomly generated or provided. 

The resulting 2d array stores information within an unknown path which can only be deciphered by using the seed to generate weights for the paths again. 

Worked on by Jonathan Lin and Tyler Szeto from Sept 2016 to Feb 2017
